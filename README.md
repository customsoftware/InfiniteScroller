# InfiniteScroller
This is a fun little project where I wanted to make an infinitely scrolling UIScrollview

I was asked to describe how to build an infinitely scrolling view on an iPhone/iPad without using a collection view of some type (UICollectionView, UITableView, UIPageView)... just a UIScrollView. This is my answer to that question.

This does use Swift 5.1. It compiles and runs on Xcode 11 beta.
